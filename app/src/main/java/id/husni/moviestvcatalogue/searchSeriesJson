It was created by Steve Tesich, who wrote the original film, and the film's director Peter Yates served as Executive Producer.\n\nAs a prequel, the series was set during the year prior to the events of the film. Shaun Cassidy took over the role of Dave Stohler, a young man mad about bicycle racing and all things Italian. Barbara Barrie, Jackie Earle Haley and John Ashton reprised their roles from the film. The television series was set in Bloomington, Indiana, but was actually shot in Athens, Georgia.\n\nThe show was caught up in the 1980 Screen Actors Guild Strike and did not begin production until that fall. While heavily promoted by ABC, it was overlooked by TV audiences once it got on the air and suffered low ratings. It was cancelled after eight episodes were filmed, though only seven episodes aired during its original run. ABC showed reruns of the show during the summer of 1981, and it was also rerun by the Arts & Entertainment cable channel during 1985–1987.",

The series covers the great lengths people have gone to make money, sometimes illegally, from casinos. It premiered in Pakistan on January 19, 2006 and was renamed Decoding Casinos in India on May 9, 2006. In the Spring of 2007, it aired on The History Channel and The Discovery Channel in Canada.\n\nMany episodes have to do with cheats who illegally take money from the casino using sleight-of-hand tricks or some sort of gizmo. Namely, these scams include pastposting and card marking. Other episodes include famous examples of legal money-making techniques such as card counting. Some episodes are about legal strategies like winning at the craps table by throwing at certain angles using a certain grip with certain numbers at the top, or taking advantage of a worn-out ball bearing and a thus tilted roulette wheel.\n\nThe series was inspired by the two-hour History Channel documovie entitled Breaking Vegas: The True Story of the MIT Blackjack Team written and directed by Bruce David Klein and produced by Atlas Media Corp.\n\nThe episode \"Professor Blackjack\" is about MIT professor Edward O. Thorp's computer-based research on the Kelly criterion that was applied in real Vegas casinos in the form of computer aided card-counting schemes with very successful results. Manny Kimmell, a known mob associate, provided the venture capital for Dr. Thorp's real life experiment and his contribution is described in the same episode.",
